SOME THINGS DO NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT

~This program is created to help system admins in Windows maintain and operate their server.~

List of 3rd party programs will have a * after them

Files              | Reason To Have
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7z.exe*		    Allows zip files to be created along with other compressions
nc.exe*             Allows for telnet server and con (your anti-virus may pick this up but it's safe)
crawl.exe	    Crawls the web for links and emails
vscan.exe	    Does virus scanning from an offline data-base
			(vscan is OK but it's recomended to get a better [3rd party] program)
main.conf	    A file that is loaded by QuickTermSE to determine certain vars like backup location and telnet settings

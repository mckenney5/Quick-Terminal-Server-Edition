// Created by Adam (Adam@quitetiny.com)
// This is an example Quick Terminal Script file (.qts)
// '//' is a comment
// '#' means a special condition (ex '#e.msg' makes every error be displayed in a message box)
// everything else that you type is treated like a command except 'wait' and 'break' which are for scripting only
// break= pause (waits for the enter key)
// wait= waits a certain amount of time. (ex 'wait 1000')
// # can be #e. or #r. (coming soon)
// #e. can be either default (prints on screen), 'log' (logs it all to a file), or 'msg' (creates a seprate msgbox for every error)
// ~ = special var like '~user'
// for 'do loops' just type 'do' <code> 'loop' (if you dont specify a number after 'do' it does it infinitly)
// for a new line just type 'echo' without anything after it
// also note that commands have a 100 millisecond delay to keep program's stability
